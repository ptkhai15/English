When you say keep a lid on something, it means keep it secret – or keep it quiet about it…

You mean you're going 'to lift the lid' on what I'm doing – that means to tell someone about something bad

When you say you are 'taking a stab in the dark' it means you don't really know the truth and you are just guessing.
